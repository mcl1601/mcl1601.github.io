                        <p>This game was developed using Unity and C# by a team of 5 including myself. The project intially started as a class project but was then expanded upon in a production studio ultimately leading to around 5 months of total development time. The game was then presented at the <em>Imagine RIT</em> festival at Rochester Institute of Technology. This was by far the most fleshed out game any of us had ever made due to the amount of time and resources we were able to sink into it. The team dynamic was great due to the fact that all of us were friends, leading to a lot of shared roles and helping out in all areas of development.<br /><br />
                        
                        There is still plenty of room for future development with this game, including enhanced physics to allow for stages to include slopes and ramps, better collision detection and resolution for more satisfying hits, more loadouts, more cars, more characters, more stages, different gamemodes, etc. As the main lead behind physics, I still have work cut out for me to perfect our physics system to produce the most satsfying experience. We've gotten the game to a great point, but there's a ton more to do. I am still most proud of this project out of all of my work.</p>

                        <p>This game was developed using Unity and C# by a team of 4 including myself. It began during a class I took at RIT named Casual Game Development. The structure of the class was set up into three 4 week sprints where we design a casual game during each of the sprints. We also received two weeks at the end of the semester to polish one of our three games, and we chose this one.<br/><br/>
                        
                        We used Unity's physics system which definitely sped up production. Just after 1 week, line drawing with proper collision was implemented as well as speed boosts and holes. After the first week, we could focus our attention on cleaning up the UI and implementing more holes as well as customization. Playtests in class allowed us to tweak physic values, adjust the UX, and gain new ideas for level mechanics. Production went pretty smoothly and we were all really happy with how the game turned out. This game was my brainchild so I was real excited to develop it.</p>

                        <p>This mod was developed during a special running of IGME 590 at RIT. The class was solely devoted to making a mod for <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>. The class was divided into 5 groups of 5 and each of our teams worked on a specific subquest in the mod, with one group managing the overarching quest. My team was responsible for the fourth and final subquest: "Stuck Between a Wererock and a Hard Place". It was a very unique class as it required communication and cooperation with all 25 students, rather than just your own group. Everyone was fairly new to modding so it was a class effort to learn and share knowledge of the Skyrim Creation Kit together.<br/><br/>
                        
                            In my team, I was mostly responsible for asset modifications. My main work consisted of retexturing the armor set to create our own unique look as well as creating stone variants of Skyrim's werewolves and werebears and creating the bloodmoon transition effect. Working with Bethesda's assets was certainly a challange, as all of their filetypes are proprietary. Texture files are coded as <code>.dds</code> and 3D models are packaged as <code>.nif</code>. This required special tools to be able to modify the existing assets.</p>

                        <p>This proof-of-concept project was a result of a solo independent studio during the spring of 2017. The game was developed in Unity using C# and a Nintendo Wii remote as a controller. I used the Unity-Wiimote plug-in to get input from the Wii remote into the Unity engine. The platform consisted of a longboard with a Wiimote attached to the bottom and the longboard was positioned on a turn table. This allowed for both the rotational and leaning movements.<br /><br />
                        In all, the project was a good learning experience into using motion controls. The Nintendo Wii remote was not the best accelerometer to use for motion controls, as it would very consistently get disoriented and constantly require zeroing out. The physical platform itself was very jerry rigged and not very user friendly. The physics were decent but the controls where really what messed with the gameplay. There is a lot of room for improvement but it was a successful proof-of-concept using a Wiimote in Unity and experimenting with physical controllers.</p>

                        <p>I had way too much fun with this project. As a big fan of music, I love watching videos of my favorite songs that incorporate the song's waveforms. I really wanted to go above and beyond and make a really cool experience with this. Built using JavaScript and web audio technologies, each "frame" of the song is divided into "buckets" based on sound frequencies. Each of these bucket values is then translated into how big each bar appears. The plethora of customization controls alter things like how tall or wide the bars should be, audio effects like reverb, and visual effects such as tinting the background.<br/><br/>
                        
                        I really wanted to make the UI look clean and modern. This was actually my first true website built with JavaScript so there are plenty of things I would like to go back and change in terms of the UI. A lot of the UI interaction is kind of hacky and not done effectively. After learning more about JS and web development, I am eager to go back and modernize some of my code. There's a few glitches with the custom audio controls but overall I was incredibly pleased with the final product. It was highly satisfying to sit and watch and listen to my work perform in front of me.</p>

                        <p>This project was to practice using Canvas while also making a game. I choose a 2D tank game since the graphics are relatively simple and physics are my speciality. I was most happy with how clean and concise the code for the game is. I used the Module Pattern to help clean up the code and break the calls down into chunks. The main update basically comes down to update the tanks, update the bullet, and check for collisions.<br /> <br />
                        
                        I initially aimed to do terrain deformation when the bullets hit the ground, but soon realized this drastically complicated     many other aspects of the game. Instead, I created a random terrain generaton algorithm that creates a new stage for each playthrough. It took some tweaking and playing around to constrain the values to make a balanced and playable stages. Overall I'm fairly happy with the gameplay, however the site design could use some work. Creating UIs in Canvas was a little tricky.</p>

                        <p>My initial plans for this app unfortunately did not come to fruition. I initially intended to make an app to search the menus of restaurants to locate specific foods you were looking for. I found the <a href="https://developers.zomato.com/api" target="_blank">Zomato API</a> and was under the impression it had the power to cross-reference menus. However, it turns out that feature was only avaiable in Czechoslovakia. So I had to salvage together the rest of the project and it will only show results that include your query in the title of the restaurant. In essence, I basically created another Google Maps to find restaurants. <br/><br/>
                        
                        Out of all my apps, I am least happy with this one. Mostly because the idea didn't fully work out, but also because the site design isn't the best. After scrambling to salvage the project, I didn't have a whole lot of time or care to clean up the design. While I do like some of the Google Material designs I created like the text boxes, the responsiveness of the site is pretty bad. Layouts and font sizing need to be adjusted and the color scheme is a little harsh.</p>

                            &emsp;My title at eLogic was open ended to allow me to float between different development mediums. I primarily worked as a mobile developer on the IoT (Internet of Things) team using Xamarin and C# to create and test apps for clients. I started off writing automated tests to run in Microsofdt App Center in order to test the UI. I also took on the role of deploying QA builds to the client through App Center for them to test. I later moved on to bug fixing. Aside from Xamarin, I also did a bit of Power Apps development. This was towards the end of my time at eLogic so I didn't get far with it. My employment was unfortunately terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

                            &emsp;One major part of the LiveTiles brand is their intranet site building platform. The individual apps and widgets you add to the site page are known as "tiles". As a developer intern, my main task included refreshing outdated and non-functional tiles to a more modern standard. Often times I would rebuild the tiles from the ground up and design the front end as well program the backend myself. I was also involved with creating demo pages for potential customers, providing support to customers who implemented my tiles, as well as create custom tiles for different customers.

                            &emsp;My primary task at Siemens was to prototype a new application to be used by railroad technicians. The app, an "IDE for programming signal box logic", was created as a WPF Application using C# in Visual Studio. As the sole programmer, I would work with a UX lead and UI designer to turn the concepts into reality. The design was insipred by the Microsoft Office suite and built to be a more modern UI over cluttered industrial style UIs. My team worked with a user group of real technicians to gain feedback and suggestions as we built out the program.

                                &emsp;One major part of the LiveTiles brand is their intranet site building platform. The individual apps and widgets you add to the site page are known as "tiles". As a developer intern, my main task included refreshing outdated and non-functional tiles to a more modern standard. Often times I would rebuild the tiles from the ground up and design the front end as well program the backend myself. I was also involved with creating demo pages for potential customers, providing support to customers who implemented my tiles, as well as create custom tiles for different customers.

                                &emsp;My primary task at Siemens was to prototype a new application to be used by railroad technicians. The app, an "IDE for programming signal box logic", was created as a WPF Application using C# in Visual Studio. As the sole programmer, I would work with a UX lead and UI designer to turn the concepts into reality. The design was insipred by the Microsoft Office suite and built to be a more modern UI over cluttered industrial style UIs. My team worked with a user group of real technicians to gain feedback and suggestions as we built out the program.
